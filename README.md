A test assignment.

Live: https://space-shooter-nine.vercel.app/
How to run locally:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies
3. Run `pnpm dev` to open the game at `http://localhost:5173/`

The game is won when:
- You have destroyed all asteroids (8 hits)

The game is lost when:
- 60 seconds have lapsed;
- You are out of ammo and the 60 seconds of game time are still going;

The game and code design is far from perfect but it kinda works.
